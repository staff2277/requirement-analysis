Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, examined, and documented to create a clear understanding of what the software system should achieve.

This process involves engaging with clients, end-users, and other stakeholders to identify both functional requirements (what the system should do) and non-functional requirements (how the system should perform). The outcome of this phase serves as the foundation for planning, designing, and developing the software product.

Key Activities in Requirement Analysis:
Requirements Elicitation: Gathering requirements through interviews, questionnaires, workshops, or observing user behavior.

Requirements Specification: Documenting the collected requirements in a clear and structured format, often in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.

Requirements Validation: Ensuring that the documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholders‚Äô needs and are feasible, complete, and unambiguous.

Requirements Management: Continuously tracking and managing changes to requirements throughout the project lifecycle.

Importance of Requirement Analysis:
üìå Reduces Risk: Identifying issues early prevents costly changes later in development.

üß≠ Guides Design and Development: Clear requirements help developers build the right product from the beginning.

ü§ù Improves Communication: Creates a common understanding among stakeholders, designers, and developers.

‚úÖ Ensures Project Success: Increases the chances of delivering a product that meets business goals and user needs.

In summary, Requirement Analysis acts as the blueprint for software development. Without it, teams risk building the wrong solution, leading to wasted time, budget overruns, and unsatisfied users.
