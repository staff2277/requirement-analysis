What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of gathering, understanding, and documenting what a software system must do. It ensures that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of system expectations. This phase involves identifying both functional and non-functional requirements and is essential for guiding design, development, and reducing risks in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
ðŸ“Œ Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis plays a vital role in the success of any software project. Here are three key reasons why it's critical in the SDLC:
Prevents Miscommunication
It ensures that all stakeholdersâ€”developers, clients, and usersâ€”have a clear and unified understanding of what the system should do. This avoids costly misunderstandings later.

Reduces Development Costs and Time
By identifying requirements early, development teams avoid unnecessary rework, helping to stay on budget and deliver on time.

Improves Product Quality
A well-analyzed set of requirements leads to a system that meets user needs and expectations, resulting in a more functional, reliable, and user-friendly product.
